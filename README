Smart Error
===========

Ever frustrated by those maintenance pages that don't tell you when the 
maintenance is done?  Concerned about users that would have come back,
but forgot to check? 

Smart Error allows a visitor to leave an email address so that you can 
contact them when the site they were trying to visit is back online.
